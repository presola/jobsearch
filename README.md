This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.6.
It's a project that shows users a list of jobs on CareerJet's public API and also allows job search,
it also shows user's selected job on a map with job's location and distance to user.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
